                <p className="wow fadeInUp">From a scientific background, I chose to realize my biggest dream and above all , achieve one of my biggest goals: to get up every morning and work without going backwards.</p>

                <p className="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s">My passion for computers in general started from my childhood thanks to my father. When Windows 98 arrive, I began to explore this world while watching my dad. Passionate about clothing but especially board sports(skate, surf, snow), I decided to take the lead by trying to create a website selling boardsports products (locally).
                A few years passed, the passion for computers never left, but studies took center stage.
                When back to high school I had a sudden urge to change my OS, so I bought my first second-hand Mac where I was able to start learning about this new operating system.
                After serious health problems, I managed to get my science baccalaureate without being able to go to class. So I started a scientific journey in medical school.
                After so many years of accumulating jobs and looking for my way in Saint Etienne, I decided to go to Lyon.
              So I worked to be able to finance my training, which was the best gift I could give myself !! So I realized that I didn't want to do anything else with my life.</p>
                <br />
                <p className="wow fadeInUp" data-wow-delay="0.2s"> After completing my training, I was lucky enough to be hired in a start-up in Lyon. This is how my career as a developer began, it has been very rewarding<br />
              Aside from the skills I acquired during my professional experiences, I train a lot at home, I make sure to be on the lookout for new technologies.</p>
